This is our final project for the Data Structures 2 course at Habib University. It delves into the comparative analysis of three tree data structures—Binary Search Trees (BSTs), Adelson-Velsky and Landis Trees (AVL), and Treaps—focusing on their search and insert functions. We meticulously crafted both standard and optimized versions of these functions and evaluated their performance using diverse datasets. Through systematic experimentation and graphical analysis, we aimed to discern the efficacy of optimization techniques in enhancing runtime efficiency. By documenting our optimization strategies and analyzing the results, we sought to provide valuable insights into the impact of optimization on tree data structure performance.
